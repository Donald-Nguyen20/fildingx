    "text": "3. Turning Operation\nTurning operation refers to the continuous or intermittent low-speed operation of the turbine\nrotor system, auxiliaries, and equipment, including the turning unit and its auxiliaries. The\nturning device consists of a turning motor as a driver and a train of reduction gears. The last\nreduction gear is a gear wheel fixed to the rotor, which rotates the rotor. The turning speed is\ncontrolled by reduction ratio for the gear train and is the speed most suitable to establish stable\nturning operation and oil film thickness.\nProper turning operation for the turning unit is dependent on the lubricating system. It is\ntherefore important that the operator understand the necessity of oil pump management for\nsupplying lubricating oil to the turning system.\nThe purposes for turning operation vary with the condition of the unit for different occasions.\nSome of the conditions and operating methods are described in this section."

    "subsection": "",
    "text": "3.1 Turning Operation before Turbine Startup\nTo prevent abnormal vibration during turbine startup, especially while increasing speed, the\nrotor eccentricity must be stable and within normal values.\nGenerally, after the unit trip, there is an unavoidable difference in temperature between the\nupper and lower halves inside the casing, with or without turning operation. During suspended\nturning operation, the rotor bends because of a deformation generated by this temperature\ndifference within the limit of elasticity. The primary purpose of turning operation prior to\nturbine startup is to prevent or correct this bending.\nNormally, the front shaft on the front side of the rotor has an eccentricity detecting terminal\nwhich allows the operator to monitor bending of the rotor by watching the value on the\neccentricity meter. The procedure for monitoring eccentricity is referred to in EKS101339\n“Turbine Operation”.\nRecommended turning operation as preparation for startup of an ordinary unit is listed below.\nMaximum temperature of casing\nRecommended operation hours\nBelow 180 °C"

    "text": "3.3 Turning Operation at Turbine Shutdown\nThe purpose of continuing the turning operation at the time of stopping the turbine is to\nminimize deformation of the rotor and casing and to cool them uniformly. Conspicuous\ndeformation of the rotor may cause contact between the stationary part and the rotating part,\nwith resulting damage. The turning operation tends to make the temperature distribution inside\nthe turbine shell and on the rotor more uniform. However, it should be noted that some\ntemperature difference between the upper and lower casing is unavoidable.\nOn the other hand, because of the construction of the turbine, the bearing bottom side is the\ncontact part between the stationary and the rotating part. When the turbine stops at a high\ntemperature, the heat is conducted in the axial direction of the rotor from the bearing surface to\nthe stationary part. Oil circulation is necessary to prevent the temperature of the bearing metal\nfrom rising.\nTurning operation at turbine stop is based on when the turning unit and/or oil pump should be\nstopped. Stopping of a turning operation may be considered as follows, with the maximum\ntemperature of the inner surface metal of the casing corresponding to the rotor system as the\nstandard.\nStopping of turning unit ...... under 250 °C\nStopping of oil pump ........... under 250 °C\nThese are the minimum operating temperature conditions for normal stopping procedure.\nTurning operation should continue as appropriate down to lower temperature or to the next\nturbine starting, if the turbine is being stopped for only a short period.\na\nE K S 1 0 1 3 3 8 - a"

Interruption of Turning Operation\nWhen the turning operation is resumed after having been interrupted for short periods, it should\nbe extended for a period 10 times as long as the period for which is was stopped.

However, the turbine metal should be\ncooled as long as possible during the time the turbine is being stopped. After the turbine has\nslowed down to a speed at which the turning operation can be started, a one-hour minimum\nturning operation is required for uniform temperature distribution of the turbine rotor before\nwork should proceed.\nTurning operation should not be suspended longer than 30 minutes. In case the work cannot be\nfinished within 30 minutes, it should be scheduled for two or more separate sessions.\nTo resume turning operation after the work has been finished when the suspension is shorter\nthan three hours, the rotor should be rotated a half turn, held for a period of about one-third as\nlong as suspension period, and then operated continuously. When the suspension is longer than\nthree hours, the rotor should be rotated a half turn and held for one hour. After that, the rotor\nshould be rotated a half turn again and held for twenty minutes, and then operated continuously.\nTurning operation must be done for ten minutes minimum before work is continued.\nThis approach is effective in quickly minimizing eccentricity caused by a rotor bent as a result\nof suspended turning operation.\nAfter the suspension for the rotor balancing adjustments, turning operation should be continued\nfor a four-hour minimum regardless of the suspension period.\nThis turning operation minimizes the temporary rotor bowing, checks the effect of the rotor\nbalancing, and should take place before the turbine startup conditions discussed in Section 3.1.\na\nE K S 1 0 1 3 3 8 - a"

High vibration and turbine trip are caused only by a serious\nmechanical difficulty.\nSmooth turning operation may be impossible when large deformation occurs at stationary and\nrotating parts as the result of heavy rubbing. In such a case, forced turning operation may\nincrease the damage to the turbine inside. Therefore, when the vibration monitor indicates a\nclear rubbing pattern during turbine slow down, further turning operation should be determined\nbased on the rubbing noise and vibration patterns. At the start of the turning operation, whether\nto have continuous operation should be determined on the basis of the electric current of the\nturning motor and the rubbing noise.\nWhen the heavy vibration is not caused by rubbing, it may be caused by imbalance resulting\nfrom inner turbine damage or the abnormal conditions of the driven rotor system, including a\ncoupling. In such cases, the vibration record chart and rubbing noises will often indicate whether\nturning operation should be continued. Generally, it is better not to continue the turning\noperation unless the cause is clear.\nNormally, when vibration has been caused by rubbing, turning operation of four hours or more\nwill correct temporary rotor bowing."

Before that period the temperature of the metal at the turbine rotor core will be below the\ntransition temperature as it is accelerated up to its operating speed.\nIn the past, a number of control system checks above the rated speed were generally\nrecommended before synchronizing either a new turbine generator unit or an older unit\nfollowing a major overhaul. These checks involved operation at speeds up to the overspeed trip\nspeed, where the stress on the turbine rotor is approximately 25 percent greater than that at 100\npercent rated speed. However, increased knowledge and understanding of rotor material\nbehavior indicates that this practice is not desirable on cold turbines.\nThe alloy materials used in turbine rotors for high-temperature operations have a greater margin\nagainst stress from overspeed operation when the rotors are above their transition temperature of\nabout 120 °C. The center of the rotor on a cold turbine will not reach 120 °C by the time the\nturbine is at rated speed. During acceleration and operation at rated speed, no load, the steam\npressure in the turbine is low and the heat transferred to the rotor is not sufficient to adequately\nheat the rotor core above the transition temperature.

    "subsection": "",
    "text": "10. Minimum Loading Recommendations\nThere is usually a minimum load point below which a turbine cannot be continuously operated\nwithout excessive heating of the exhaust hood structure and other latter-stage components. The\nheating is the result of rotational losses in the last stages which are greater at the lower steam\nflows associated with low-load operation.\nThe amount of heating which occurs depends on a number of variables such as inlet steam\ntemperatures, the absolute pressure in the condenser, the load being carried by the turbine, and\nthe configuration of the exhaust hood and condenser. Because of these variables, the minimum\nload on a particular turbine at which the exhaust hood will not overheat can best be determined\nby field experience.\nThe low-pressure stages of reheat turbines operate at higher temperature levels when running at\nlow loads, because the reheat cycle introduces steam into the turbine at higher temperatures at a\nlower pressure level in the steam path. Water sprays are located at the exit side of the turbine last\nstage buckets to reduce or control the exhaust hood temperature on reheat turbines.\nMoisture erosion of the buckets in the last few stages is increased by low-load operation. This is\ndue to moisture from the water sprays being recirculated through the roots and out of the tips of\nthe last-stage buckets and to inherent moisture in the steam which is dependent on the flow\ntemperature characteristic of the boiler."

Low Load Operation Limits\n\nThe following limits should be placed on low load operation:\n• The unit can be operated continuously at light loads when the exhaust hood temperature is\n80°C or less, but the turbine is not available for rapid load increase. Because of the variables\ninvolved, the load point at which this temperature occurs is not exact, but is usually at no\nload.\n• The unit is available for rapid load increase when the exhaust hood temperature is 52°C or\nless. This temperature occurs at about ten percent of rated load or considerably less with the\nuse of water sprays.\n• When the exhaust hood temperature is above 52 °C, the load should be increased slowly until\nthe temperature falls below 52 °C, then may be increased in accordance with the regular\nprocedure.\n• Operation below five percent load should be held at a minimum because of increased\nmoisture erosion of the latter-stage buckets.\n• Motoring, revolving the turbine rotor in the opposite direction, of the unit is to be avoided or\nlimited to short duration in emergency operation in order to prevent overheating the exhaust\nhood and moisture erosion of the buckets.

    "text": "3. Turbine and feedwater cycle efficiency will decrease when any feedwater heater is removed\nfrom service.\nConditions 1 and 2 will change the stage pressure drops and steam flow through the turbine,\naffecting the bucket, diaphragm, and thrust loadings.\nThese higher loading conditions can be determined and may be a consideration in the original\nturbine design. In this plant, feedwater heaters and bypass system is provided as following.\n(Figure 12.1).\nLoading Condition A--One or more nonadjacent heaters may be removed from service, providing\nthe steam flow is adjusted so that the name plate kilowatt rating is not exceeded.\nLoading Condition B--If operation at nameplate kilowatts is desired when the adjacent heaters\nare removed from service, all the heaters at higher pressures must also be removed from service.\nThe heaters must be removed from service in sequence, starting with the highest pressure heater,\nand proceeding in order to the lowest pressure heater to be removed from service. Similarly,\nwhen the heaters are returned to service, the lowest pressure heater must be placed in service\nfirst, then in proceeding order to the highest pressure heater. The steam flow must be adjusted\nso the kilowatt load does not exceed the name plate kilowatt rating.\nLoading Condition C--The turbine may be operated with the highest pressure heater in service,\nand any combination of adjacent lower pressure heaters out of service, provided the steam flow is\nadjusted to facilitate at least a 10 percent load reduction from nameplate kilowatt rating for each\nadditional adjacent heater removed from service. This is approximately a 10 percent load\nreduction for two adjacent heaters out of service, 20 percent for three adjacent heaters out of\nservice, and so on. The maximum load reduction of 50 percent from nameplate kilowatt rating\nis usually sufficient to limit all bucket, diaphragm, and thrust loadings, at levels no greater than\ndesign, with normal heater operation. Vibration in the extraction stage will also be considerably\nreduced. Operation at higher than rated loads with the heaters out of service is always the owner's\nresponsibility, because such operation encroaches upon design margins. This encroachment\nincreases as additional feedwater heaters are removed from service. Harmful bucket,\ndiaphragm, or thrust loadings may result from operation with feedwater heaters out of service\nexcept as described in Loading Conditions A, B, and C above.\na\nE K S 1 0 1 3 3 8 - a"

    "text": "3. Introduction\nThis section provides the procedure for routine startup and shutdown of the turbine. The\nrecommended sequence for placing the turbine and its related equipment in or out of service is\na practical procedure which can contribute to the satisfactory performance of the turbine\ngenerator.\nIt is extremely important that most of the operating steps be carried out in the sequence given\nhere, and that recommendations be closely followed. Toshiba ESS Corporation acknowledges\nthat the practices of different generating organizations may deviate from the sequence\nrecommended in this manual, and it is not possible to address every deviation from the\nprocedure and the conditions under which such deviations are permissible.\nTherefore, any deviation from recommended operating procedure should be undertaken only by\nexperienced personnel at the responsibility of the power generating organization.\nThe operator should use this procedure as a checklist to avoid omitting any necessary operation.\nExperienced operating personnel should exercise judgment in deviating from the operating\npractices recommended here.\nFor example, in turbine shutdown, if condenser vacuum is broken, deceleration of the turbine is\ngreater because of the increased windage, and shut-down time is reduced. However, there is no\nreason vacuum must be broken at all, so long as the steam seal system remains in operation.\nExperienced personnel will know that this is highly advantageous for a shutdown of short\nduration, because if air is not drawn into the condensate system, condenser vacuum does not\nhave to be reestablished for restarting. The steam seal system should never be shut down before\nzero vacuum is obtained.\nThe successful operation, maintenance, and long life of a turbine-generator are dependent, to a\nlarge extent, on the proper startup, loading, shutdown, and load changing procedures. These\nprocedures become more important as units undergo frequent starting and loading cycles.\nIn many instances, a turbine may appear to start without difficulty, in spite of the use of improper\nmethods. During early service trouble may not be evident, but unnecessary damage may be\noccurring that will not be identified until much later. These damages may include packing\nrubbing, shell distortion, or the cracking of turbine parts. These conditions can be avoided if\nproper operating methods are used.\nRecent failures of major turbine components have been directly attributable to cracking from\naccumulated strain damage, which resulted from numerous heating and cooling cycles\nconducted frequently and at rates in excess of Toshiba's recommendations. Analysis further\nindicates that the thermal strains associated with quick cooling times are likely to swiftly drive\ncracks deeper.\nThese starting and loading instructions are designed primarily to minimize cyclic damage to the\nhigh temperature rotors, but they also limit cyclic damage to the shells. The turbine rotors are\nrecognized to be the limiting equipment in most modern turbine generator units. When the shells\nare more limiting, it is by a small margin.\na\nE K S 1 0 1 3 3 9 - a"

    "text": "4.1. Thermal Stress and Distortion\nDuring steady state operation, the combined pressure and thermal stresses in the valves and\nshells, and combined centrifugal and thermal stresses in the rotors are maintained at a relatively\nlow level. However, during transient operations such as startup, shutdown, load changes, and\nemergencies, large thermal stresses can be added to the pressure stress in the shells and valves\nand to the centrifugal stresses in the rotors. A severe transient may produce yielding, which\nconsumes a certain percentage of the fatigue life of the yielded component. The amount of life\nexpenditure depends on the level of combined stress reached during each operation. It is\ntherefore important to limit these stresses to an acceptable level by controlling the rates of\ntemperature change.\n4.1.1.\nTemperature\nControl. The primary objective during turbine starting and loading is the gradual, uniform\nheating of critical turbine parts to minimize thermal stress. The critical portions include the\ncontrol valve chest, first-stage nozzle bowl passages, first-stage shell area, high-pressure and\nreheat rotors, and for most units, the stop-valve casing.\nThese parts are mainly in the hottest portions of the turbine in the high-pressure and reheat\nsections.\n4.1.2.\nTemperature Limitations\nTemperature differences across the thick walls of shells and valves should not exceed\nmaximums recommended on separate curves of allowable temperature difference, Figures 4.1\nand 4.2. These curves are designed to optimize the life expenditure per cycle in the stationary\nparts.\nRates of change of metal temperature should not exceed the maximums recommended on the\nseparate curve of cyclic damage curve of rotor. This curve for the high-pressure section is shown\non Figure 4.3.\nThese rates of change limits are based on limiting the life expenditure per cycle in the high-\npressure rotor to satisfactory levels. Because dependable measurements of rotor temperature are\nnot practical, the temperature of the closest stationary parts must be used as a substitute. The\nthermocouple closest to the high-pressure rotor is at the first-stage shell inner surface. The\nlimitations are given in the form of curves of rate of metal temperature change as a function of\nthe amount of metal temperature change expected, for various rotor surface cyclic life\nexpenditures given in percent per cycle.\na\nE K S 1 0 1 3 3 9 - a"

    "subsection": "",
    "text": "4.2. Vibration\nDuring the rolling period, particularly on new turbines with tight packings, light packing\nrubbing may develop regardless of optimum procedures and thermal conditions. This is more\nlikely to occur when operating near critical speed when the midspan rotor deflections are at\nmaximum. If the rubbing exists because of increased vibration while operating below or near a\ncritical speed, the turbine should be shut down immediately and put on turning gear for one or\ntwo hours. This procedure will straighten the shaft, and a restart usually can be accomplished\nwithout further rubbing.\nContinued operation at or near the critical speed will usually increase the bowing at an\naccelerating rate, damaging the turbine packings and reducing turbine efficiency. In extreme\ncases, permanent rotor bowing can result.\nRubbing during rolling is minimized by steady, smooth acceleration, particularly through the\ncritical speeds. Below critical speeds, unbalance caused by rotor bow increases the bow, leading\nto harder rubbing and, consequently, more bowing. At speeds above critical, unbalance caused\nby bowing tends to decrease the bow and relieve rubbing.\nRubbing at speeds above critical is not as troublesome as at lower speeds. Through the critical\nspeed range, deflections of the rotor may be greatly amplified; therefore, operators should\naccelerate through the critical speeds quickly.\nOperators of a particular unit will quickly learn its starting characteristics, and will be able to\ndifferentiate normal and abnormal vibration levels at any given speed. As the unit is accelerated,\nfor example, it is perfectly normal for the vibration at the generator journal bearings to increase\nin amplitude at the generator's first critical speed. Amplitudes less than 150μm might be\nconsidered normal and 200μm acceptable. This value is usually constant for a particular unit\nand will not vary much with operating circumstances. In some cases, the last turbine bearing\nwill respond in part with the generator, and this may also be normal.\nThe 3000 rpm turbine shaft vibration amplitudes, especially HP shafts, will rarely be higher\nthan 75μm at low speeds under 900 rpm. If they should reach 125μm it indicates severe\nrubbing. Modern large steam turbines for 3000 rpm operation have first rotor critical speeds in\nthe range between 900 and 2700 rpm. At these speeds some increase in shaft vibration amplitude\nis normal.\nIn deciding whether normal vibration exists, operators should consider whether the peak\nvibration speed has been reached or approached, and how fast the vibration is changing. In\ngeneral, at or near the turbine's first critical speed, shaft vibration amplitudes should not exceed\ntwice the normal amplitudes.\nIn a few cases, vibration amplitudes near 150μm are normal for a particular unit, and slightly\nhigher than this is tolerable for a few moments while the turbine is accelerating through the\ncritical speed range.\nAt the first indication of abnormal vibration levels while below the critical speed range, or while\npassing through it, the unit should be instantly tripped and placed on turning gear. After a well\nbalanced unit has passed through the critical speed range, the vibration amplitudes will diminish.\na\nE K S 1 0 1 3 3 9 - a"

    "text": "5.7. Turbine Shutdown Procedure\nA controlled shutdown procedure is desirable for the proper operation of the turbine during load\nreduction and subsequent shutdown of the unit.\nAs in turbine startup, the control of turbine metal temperature is extremely important since this\nwill affect thermal stress, differential expansions, distortion or alignment of parts, and the flow\nof heat from one portion of the turbine to another.\nVarious procedures should be developed for each system. These procedures should be governed\nby the conditions desired at shutdown, or which are later desired at restarting.\nIdentical turbines may require different procedures adapted to the related equipment and\ncontrols. The emergency or trip functions of the control equipment, and the normal turbine\ncontrol operation are described in the description instructions. In addition, the tests to be\nperformed periodically during shutdown are described in “Surveillance Test”.\nLoad should be reduced at a uniform rate of decrease of inner surface metal temperature, as\ngiven on the cyclic damage curve of the rotor chart.\nWhen the desired minimum load has been reached, trip the machine off line to stop the steam\nsupply to the turbine. If it is necessary to open the vacuum breaking valve, open it below the\nrecommended speed. If emergency conditions dictate that the shaft be stopped as quickly as\npossible, break the vacuum immediately. When the unit is tripped while operating under any\nappreciable load, do not open the circuit breakers until the main stop valves are closed. This\nshould provide the best protection against overspeed within the turbine if the main stop valves\nfail to close properly.\nNOTE\n■ The shorter the period of the shutdown cycles, the greater must be the coordination and precision\nof the operation. To ensure the best conditions when the turbine is restarted, the shutdown\nprocedure should remove the load in orderly fashion; perform any safely tests required; avoid\nundesirable stresses in the turbine metal; prevent distortions of the hot parts, including valves,\nshells, and rotors; and operate the unit and all auxiliary equipment during load reduction and\nshutdown.\n5.7.1.\nGeneral Shutdown\nFor many units, the characteristics of the main steam supply enable relatively small changes in\nmain steam temperatures to take place during a large portion of the load reduction period. This\nis frequently advantageous because if the steam temperature is to remain about constant during\nthe unloading, the temperature changes within the turbine will be held to a minimum. The\ntemperature of the parts in the region of the first stage will change the greatest amount.\nAs load is reduced at constant throttle conditions, the first-stage temperature will decrease by\nthe amount given by the curve of first-stage temperature versus load. Below the control point of\nthe boiler, the unloading rate should be reduced to compensate for the decrease in main steam\ntemperature to remain within the metal temperature rate of change limit.\na\nE K S 1 0 1 3 3 9 - a"

This is desirable when only a short time is available for an outage and work is to be\nperformed on the turbine. This will permit the shortest time between shutdown and disassembly,\nlessen the possibility of thermal distortion of the parts, and reduce the discomfort of operating\npersonnel.\nCooling may be accomplished during the load reduction by decreasing the main steam\ntemperature. This decrease should be gradual and uniform, not exceeding the allowable rate of\nmetal temperature decrease nor the allowable metal wall differentials. To accomplish the\ngreatest decrease in temperature, it may be necessary to reduce steam pressure as well.\nThis method of cooling will produce the greatest temperature decrease in the high-pressure\nsection of the turbine, and the effect on the portion of the turbine from the crossover point to\nthe exhaust will be progressively less.\n5.7.3.\nShutdown in the Shortest Period\nWhen a shutdown is required in the shortest period of time, the emergency rate of temperature\nchange decrease limit may be used. The time required to shut down can further be reduced by\ntripping the unit as soon as load has been reduced to 1/3 rated.\n5.7.4.\nLoad Removal and Shutdown\nLoad should be reduced in such a way as to limit the rate of change of first-stage shell inner\nsurface metal temperature to the values given on the cyclic damage curve of rotor chart.\nAlthough other methods are used, some of the most desirable are described below in the order"

However, if the shutdown is for an indefinite period, or if the unit is to\nbe disassembled, operate the turning gear until the turbine is thoroughly cooled.\nIf the turbine is to be disassembled, the turning gear should remain in operation until the upper\nshell is to be lifted. Whenever a turbine is to be opened soon after a shutdown, or the unit must\nbe removed prematurely from turning gear, it is beneficial to cool the turbine during the shut-\ndown. This may be accomplished primarily by reducing the main steam temperature as much as\npossible during the period of the load reduction.\nIf the unit is too hot when the turning gear is stopped, the turbine rotor and shell will become\ndistorted, which may cause high thermal stresses or subsequent interference of the moving parts.\nDetails of the turning operation are described in “General Description for Special Condition\nTurbine Operation”.\n5.7.6.\nRemoval of Lagging\nDo not remove turbine lagging and heat retention material from the high and intermediate-\npressure sections of the unit until these portions have cooled for 24 hours or longer. This will\nprevent overstress or deformation of the shells, including flanges.

The steam temperature prevailing at the time the machine was operating under minimum\nload, immediately before tripping of the unit, directly affects the rate of turbine cooling, as\nwell as the final temperatures during a shutdown of a weekend or less.\n\n2. The bottled-up pressure maintained in the steam generator during shutdown affects the\ntemperature to which the main steam leads and valving are subjected. The final temperature\nof the turbine shell is affected by the transmission of heat through these parts if the\nshutdown is of about 8 hours or longer. The steam temperature upon restarting may also be\ndependent upon the heat stored in the boiler and the main piping."

The actual amount of thrust increase can be 10 times normal. The greater\ndensity of water, as compared to steam, prevents the proper acceleration and direction of the\nwater by the turbine nozzles. The relative velocity of the water is therefore backward against the\nbuckets instead of through them, and a large pressure drop develops across the buckets.\n\n4.2 Damaged Buckets\nAs the point of water entry downstream from the turbine inlet, the length of the buckets in the\nstage first encountered by the water increases, and so does the likelihood of damaged or broken\nbuckets, primarily due to impact. Last-stage bucket damage in the nature of numerous cracked\ntie wires or covers, and in extreme cases, broken buckets, almost always results when a turbine\nrunning at rated speed receives water from an extraction line at the low-pressure turbine stage."

Detection of Water Induction with Thermocouples\nFrequently, the first signs of water induction into a turbine are rough starts, hammering of steam\nlines, high rotor eccentricity, or large differential expansions. During repair work there will be\nevidence of damage such as heavily rubbed packing and small cracks in rotating and stationary\nparts. To better determine if water induction is causing these symptoms and to help identify the\nsource of the water, turbines should be equipped with detection thermocouples.\nThermocouples should be provided in the steam seal header near the admission valve to record\nthe steam temperature at this point on the turbine metal temperature recorder. Water or cold\nsteam in the steam seal header can be detected by very low temperatures or abrupt changes in\ntemperature indicated on the recorder. The cause can be easily established by relating\ntemperature changes to operation of the admission valve or transfer of the sealing steam source.\nThermocouples are provided for the detection of water in high and reheat turbine shells. Located\nin pairs top and bottom at several points axially in the outer shells, recorded temperatures from\nthese thermocouples make it possible to determine at which opening in the turbine the water\nenters.\nUnder normal conditions the top and bottom thermocouples in a pair will indicate approximately\nthe same temperature. An abrupt decrease in temperature of the bottom thermocouple, or a\nsubstantial differential between the top and bottom temperature of a pair, indicates the presence\nof water and resulting shell distortion.\nThermocouples cannot prevent water from entering the turbine but they can detect it when it\ndoes.

    "text": "7.1 Extraction Systems\nExtraction systems are the most frequent source of water involved in turbine mishaps. With\nnumerous extraction openings in the turbine and the presence of water a short distance from\neach, many combinations of equipment failure, operating error, and system design weakness can\nlead to serious consequences. Experience has shown that there are four basic causes of water\ninduction involving extraction systems.\n(1) Leaking feedwater heater tubes.\n(2) Failure or inadequacy of heater level controls.\n(3) Inadequate or improper arrangement of heater and extraction line drains.\n(4) Leakage or faulty operation of valves where extraction lines are interconnected with such\nsources of steam as startup supply for deaeration.\nHeater high-level alarms (N.W.L +160mm) often precede water induction from an extraction\nline. When this is the case, water detection is only a matter of heeding the alarm, and identifying\nthe source is usually easy. Water detection thermocouples are the best means of identifying the\nsource.\nDependable high-level (N.W.L +160mm) alarm switches are essential because turbine damage\ncan be minimized or prevented if action is taken immediately when a high level alarm occurs.\nLevel switches must be tested on a regular schedule. A complete test that raises the water level\nin the sensing line and actuates the switch by moving the float is time consuming, but is the only\nadequate test.\nHeater level controls regulate the flow of condensate from the heater to maintain a constant\nheater level. The rate of flow varies greatly over the full load range of the plant and must be\nchanged rapidly at times during startup, load changes, and tripping of the turbine. The level\ncontrols must not permit level surges in the heater that will actuate the level alarms. As soon as\npossible after a new unit begins operation, the level control system should be tuned and\nmodified, if necessary, to completely eliminate these false alarms.\nAny malfunction in the level sensor, valve controller, actuator and associated air lines that shut\noff the flow of condensate will cause the water level to rise. The rising level reduces and\neventually stops the condensation of steam in the heater. This situation is dangerous. Unless all\nflow of water into the shell side of the heater from higher pressure heaters and other sources\nsuch as leaking feedwater heater tubes is shut off, the level will continue to rise and cause water\nto enter the turbine.\nThis can happen very quickly if the heater is at an elevation above the turbine.\nA heater should be bypassed immediately when improper functioning is indicated either by a\nhigh-level (N.W.L +160mm) alarm or thermocouples in the feedwater line. Where heaters are\nnot bypassed individually and a bank of several must be bypassed to remove any one from\nservice, load may need to be substantially reduced because of turbine restrictions on operation\na\nE K S 1 0 1 3 4 0 - a"

Bypassing each heater individually provides more freedom for\nprompt operator action.\nExtraction check valves (or nonreturn valves) are provided in most of the extraction lines from a\nsteam turbine. Their primary function is to prevent steam from entering the turbine on loss of\nload, and thus they are an important element in the control which protects the turbine against\nexcessive overspeed. For this purpose, they are not required in the extraction line on reheat\nturbines where steam is extracted from the cold reheat line because the reheat stop valves and\nintercept valves protect the turbine from energy in that heater. In addition, by restricting water\nstorage in the shell side of the lowest pressure heaters, it is generally possible to permit the\nomission of extraction check valves for overspeed protection. However, extraction check valves\nalso provide an important means of protecting the turbine against water induction. Therefore, the\nbest practice to protect the turbine is to provide check valves, power closed on heater level, in\nevery extraction line.\nCheck valves may not seal tightly when needed to stop the backflow of water into the turbine.\nThis may be the result of distortion arising from the colder water coming in contact with only a\nportion of the body. For this reason, it is important to open the extraction line drain on the\nturbine side of the extraction check valve whenever the presence of water is indicated.\nShutoff valves in the extraction lines provide the tightest shutoff to prevent water induction.\nThese valves should be motor-operated and equipped with controls to run the valves closed on\ninduction of high level in the heater. If high level is caused by leaking heater tubes, it is still\nnecessary to bypass the heater to prevent the heater shell safety valve from opening. In any\nevent, the turbine is protected.\nThe extraction line drains on the turbine side of a check valve or shutoff valve must prevent\nmoisture from accumulating in the line and backing up into the turbine. These starting drains\nshould be motor-operated and may be closed with the heater in service. These drain valves\nshould go open on a signal from the heater high-level switch. The drain valves in extraction lines\nmay be closed above 15 percent load. Steam traps in these lines are not considered adequate\nprotection and should only be used in parallel with the extraction line drain valve. These drains\nmust be connected to the condenser.\nAny isolation valve not normally used during startup and operation should be locked open."

It is recommended that the\nturbine not be run for long periods with the initial pressure regulator out of service.\nWhen boiler operating conditions are unstable and could lead to water carryover or cold steam\nentering the turbine, the unit should be tripped.\nContinuing to admit steam to a turbine when fires have gone out in the boiler is particularly\nhazardous and is almost never justified.\nSome once-through boilers produce water at full rated boiler pressure against the turbine stop\nvalves during the boiler startup cycle. Quenching of the stop valves and water admission from\nmisoperation or leaking valves can be serious problem on these units. The feedwater heaters in\nmany of these cycles are pressurized during startup, increasing the possibility of water entering\nthe turbine from these sources. The design and maintenance of the controls and equipment with\nthese systems should be carefully considered.\nSeveral outages have been attributed to inadequate draining of the main steam leads or boiler\nsuperheater. Turbine stop valve before-seat drains will drain the valve body and a portion of the\nmain steam leads.\nThey are not sized to drain the entire linen from boiler to turbine, and additional steam lead\ndrains must be provided.\nSeveral cases of severe turbine quenching have not been fully explained, but are believed to\nhave been caused by moisture from the super-heater or main steam leads. These incidents\noccurred during hot startup which were made a very short time after tripping. It may be that the\nboiler fires are extinguished when the turbine trips, the boiler is purges, and the superheater is\ncooled, causing condensation. The turbine is then restarted before satisfactory drainage has\noccurred, and the water is carried into the turbine by the steam flow.\nInstrumentation sensitive to temperature, pressure, or density in the steam lines might detect\npassage of several pounds of water, but the responses would be too slow to protect the turbine\nby tripping. For warnings of impending water induction, operators must rely upon indications of\ndrum level instability and rapidly decreasing temperature and pressure that precede actual\ncarryover. Connecting the thrust failure relay or thrust bearing wear detector to trip the turbine\nwill usually limit the damage to the thrust bearing. Otherwise, extensive damage from axial\nrubbing will accompany a thrust bearing failure.\nWhen water flow causes a thrust bearing failure, several effects will help verify that water was\nthe cause. If the temperature has been in the superheat region, it will suddenly drop to saturation\ntemperature and the temperature recorders will show it. If it has occurred at startup when\ntemperatures are low, it may be more difficult to detect. The sudden temperature drop may cause\ntemporary leakage from the stop valve heads and the horizontal joints of the turbine casing\nbecause of the internal surface contractions. Flowmeters will generally indicate a sudden\nincrease in flow. The flow does not increase but the passage of water through the flow nozzle\ncauses a large pressure drop, giving a false indication."

Instances of severe thermal shocking of the turbine that did not cause an outage\nhave been more frequent.\nThese instances have usually occurred with steam seal systems using an auxiliary steam source.\nSuch systems have become more prevalent with the increased use of once-through boilers.\nWhen the source of sealing steam is transferred from the man source to an auxiliary source after\nshutting down, there will be no steam from the HP packings to mix with the steam initially\nadmitted. The initially admitted steam will go to both the higher temperature HP packings as\nwell as the LP packings. The temperature of this auxiliary sealing steam must therefore be\nwithin the matching limits.\nThe line from the auxiliary source should be properly drained so that accumulated water will not\nbe blown into the steam seal header when the auxiliary feed valve opens.\nIn some instances, spray water is used to attemperate the auxiliary supply steam, and additional\nprecautions, such as the addition of moisture separators, are required.\nThe steam seal header has a continuous drain from its lowest point to the condenser, to prevent a\ngradual accumulation of water from flooding the header and entering the turbine. This drain can\nbecome plugged and therefore should be periodically checked. In any case, the drain is not\nsufficient to pass large quantities of water if admitted into the steam seal system. When there is a\nthermocouple in the steam seal header it is very useful for detecting either a plugged drain or\nproblems with cold steam admitted into the header.\nExcess steam from the steam seal system must not be discharged to an extraction line when\nthere is no extraction steam flow in that line or moisture may be blown into the turbine. On units\nhaving a steam seal diverting valve, interlocks are provided which divert the flow of steam to the\ncondenser in the event that conditions would force hot unloading steam back into the turbine,\nthereby causing shell distortion. It is the responsibility of the operator to divert this flow to the\ncondenser when the feedwater heater is not functioning and there is no extraction steam flow.\nA switch to the steam seal diverting valve relay is provided for this purpose."

The\neccentricity detector shows the tendency of the rotor bows and indicates whether or not the\nturning operation should be continued. Under turning gear operation, shaft eccentricity should\nnot exceed 10 percent of normal value, or an absolute value of 110 percent.\nTo ensure the smooth acceleration of the unit, the turning gear should remain in service\ncontinuously for more than one hour after the absolute value of 110 percent is reached. If this is\nnot possible, turbine speed can be increased when the readings of shaft eccentricity become\nstable, providing that shaft vibration is carefully monitored by the operator during acceleration.\nAlthough it may be possible to increase turbine speed beyond this limitation, it is not\nrecommended because of the possibility of severe vibration due to rotor rubbing.\nThe normal eccentricity value should be determined during the initial turning operation after 5\nhours or more of continuous operation on turning gear. Before rolling the turbine off turning\ngear, check the eccentricity reading on the eccentricity detector and compare it with this\npredetermined value.\nAfter rolling off, the eccentricity shown on the eccentricity detector is the degree of the shaft\nvibration amplitude rather than the measurement of the eccentricity itself. Therefore, the\nindication on the eccentricity detector depends on the turbine speed range.\nSpecifications for rotating speed are shown in Table 4.1.\na"

The alignment of bearing tends to change slightly under lower\nloads, higher vacuum, and other transient conditions, since the normal bearing alignment is\nestablished under steady-state conditions. The change of vibration amplitude in these levels\nshould occur slowly, and the total amplitude achieved under these conditions should not exceed\nthe permissible range. If for some reason the turbine is forced to operate under a severe transient\ncondition, the operators should monitor the vibration level closely throughout the operation in\nthat condition.\nHigh vibration amplitudes can be reduced by rebalancing the rotor or remachining the rotor\njournal.

These operating conditions\nshould be identified during the initial operating period of the turbine. It is also important to\ndetermine when bearing rubbing contributes to abnormal vibration levels. Shaft movement\ninside the bearing or casing distortion during construction can cause rubbing, but these causes\nare extremely unlikely since care is taken during construction to prevent both conditions.\nHowever, in rare cases, rubbing may be experienced during initial or transient operations\nbecause of tight clearances between the rotor and casing. The preferred way to determine if\nbearing rubbing is causing the abnormal vibration is to carefully observe the vibration amplitude\nand its rate of increase during startup and shutdown. The operator may want to consider\nmonitoring this amplitude by computer. If turbine startups and shutdowns are infrequent,\nobservation of the vibration amplitude is adequate; it is not necessary to observe the rate of\nincrease.\na"

Shell expansion data taken at various steady-state operating conditions provides\nuseful information regarding turbine operation. For example, when considerable turbine\ndifferential expansion occurs during turbine startup, it is possible to estimate the future tendency\nof this expansion by comparing the current expansion to the compiled expansion data at similar\nstartup conditions. The operator can then determine if the startup procedure should be suspended\nby estimating the total expansion. It is not necessary to observe the shell expansion during\nturbine startup unless the differential expansion exceeds the limits. If the difference from the\ndesign value is too great, even at steady-state conditions, grease or lubricant should be supplied\nto sliding parts. The value of shell expansion at the turbine rated condition for this equipment is\nprovided at the end of this section."

When the expansion resulting from the centrifugal force is very\nsmall, the red mark and the orange band can be considered as included in the red band.\nThe red mark is the limit for turbine startup condition. However, because thermal expansion and\ncentrifugal contraction are both occurring during startup, the board will not indicate contraction\nif thermal expansion is greater. In such cases, the red mark may be disregarded, provided the\noperating condition remains within the maximum rotor short range.\nThese deviations should be referred to the Toshiba Turbine Design Division.\nDisplay boards are plant specific. For some cases, the orange band and the red mark are revised.\nAn indicator showing differential expansion is shown on Figure 5.2.\nIt is essential to operate the turbine so that the indicator never enters into the red band. To ensure\nthis does not happen, the operator should observe the indicator for differential expansion\ntendencies, especially during transient operating condition. For satisfactory startup, the indicator\nmust be positioned between the red mark and the outside of the orange band, or second alarm\npoint, provided the red mark and orange band are indicated on the board. If there is still a\npossibility of turbine trip when operating at the rated speed, the indicator should be between the\nfirst alarm point and the inside of the orange band.\nAppropriate actions should be considered for all operating conditions under which the indicator\nnears the red band. To determine the appropriate action, is should be remembered that the\nturbine rotor will change temperature faster, and expand faster, than the shell. Therefore, if the\nindicator is near the red band of the rotor long side, cooling is effective; if the indicator nears the\nrotor short side, heating is effective. A practical way to heat or cool the turbine rotor is to change\nthe steam condition and turbine load. If the indicator nears either red band during load change,\nthe load should be held to determine the tendency of the indicator and then the operation should\nbe changed accordingly.\nIf the indicator enters the red band following every possible measure to correct the condition, the\nturbine shall be manually tripped. In this case, slight contact may be unavoidable during turbine\nspeed coast down.\nShell and Differential Expansion are shown on Figure 5.2.\nThe full expanded shell at the front standard, near No.1 Bearing under steady state operation\nwith rated conditions is 29.2 mm.\na"

The\ntemperature is measured at the outlet of the oil cooler or the common piping of the oil feed.\nWhen long-term turning operation is required, the oil temperature should be kept as low as\npossible, unless the power required by the oil pump is causing it to overload. Oil film thickness\nshould be limited to the degree required to prevent metal to metal contact. However, the oil\ntemperature should be adjusted to the proper conditions required to start the Auxiliary Oil Pump\nat the turbine startup. During turbine acceleration, the upper and lower oil temperature limits\nshould be observed as an indication of metal to metal contact and oil whip. The lower limit can\nbe ignored unless an abnormal condition such as oil whip is observed. The lower limit is sensed\nby the monitoring system for shaft vibration, because the abnormal condition caused by oil whip\nappears as an increase in vibration level. During acceleration it may be difficult to keep the oil\ntemperature within its lower limit because of the variations of oil flow and bearing\ncharacteristics. In this case, the lower limit setting can be modified unless the problem occurred\nduring initial trial operation.\nThe upper limit cannot be modified easily because of difficulties in obtaining sufficient oil film\nthickness between parts. For any modifications to this condition, the Toshiba engineer should be\nconsulted. During turbine shutdown, the same pattern is applied as for startup. It is possible to\nstart the turning gear with the oil temperature below the limit if the recommended limit will be\nreached within 15 minutes and the oil cooler is operating. These considerations are made by\nregarding the shutdown process being performed uniformly, without a holding speed, and in a\nshort time compared to the starting conditions. However, trouble occurs in the lubricating\nsystem when the temperature of the turning gear start is much higher than the upper limit or if it\ndoes not drop to the upper limit within 15 minutes. When either condition occurs,\ncountermeasures should be taken, and the information should be sent to the Toshiba design\nsection.\nIn addition, the permissible maximum feed oil temperature for the turning gear start condition\nmay be considered 39 C and lower, even though the limit is determined on the basis of\noperating conditions for each specific unit.\na"

This results in high exhaust hood temperatures which adversely affect turbine\ncomponents such as the exhaust hood.\nThe primary turbine temperature limits relate to overheating in the exhaust hood. This is caused\nby rotational friction loss at or near the last stage buckets during low load or no load operation.\nIn normal conditions, the exhaust hood temperature is the saturation temperature corresponding\nto that vacuum. Overheating has occurred when the exhaust hood temperature is higher than the\nsaturation temperature. In such cases the exhaust hood spray is placed in service automatically to\ncool the exhaust hood. Operators should carefully observe the exhaust hood during special\nconditions. For example, when held at low load or no load after rapid unloading from high load,\noverheating may easily occur near the last stage, because the temperature of the boiler reheater\nand turbine steam path is not cooled immediately after the trip. This should be carefully watched\nbecause the recorder indicates values lower than actual as a result of the automatic exhaust hood\nspray.\nThese abnormal conditions can be detected in some degree by observing the tendency of\ndifferential expansion. However, the stress of last stage bucket and casing must be carefully\nanalyzed to know the severity of this effect. Thus, such an operation should be avoided."

    "text": "9.4 Allowable Temperature Difference between Upper and Lower Casing\nThe temperature difference between the upper and lower casings can be determined by using the\nthermocouples provided as the water induction detector. These thermocouples are mounted as a\nset on each main upper and lower steam chamber and provide signals to a recorder. These\nsignals can be interpreted to provide a temperature distribution of the turbine casing in the axial\ndirection.\n\n9.4.1 Water Induction Limits\nA rapid temperature decrease in the lower casing or an increase in the temperature difference\nbetween the upper and lower casings may indicate turbine water induction. It should be noted\nthat a temperature difference between the upper and lower casings exceeding the difference\nindicated in Section 9.4.2 does not necessarily mean that water induction has occurred. The\noperator must consider the rate of temperature change in the lower casing and should observe\nother instruments associated with water induction detection, to determine the existence of water\ninduction."

This is based on the fact that the exciting force is not always small under no\nload operation but can be larger than that of the low load region. It is hard to cause resonance\nwhen passing the critical points during operations such as startup, shut--down, governor test, etc.\nTherefore, it is not necessary to account for the time it takes to pass through the critical points\nduring these operations when calculating blade life. However, if for some reason the speed is\nheld constant at an off-frequency during these operations, this time must be considered in blade\nlife computations. When some speed holding is necessary, the previous equation should be\napplied and the speed run back into the safety zone as soon as possible.\nOn controlling the life of blades according to the previous equation, if the accumulating damage\nbecomes 0.8 - 0.9, the possibility of crack initiation increases and the blades must be checked at\nthe next periodic inspection.\nWhen the damage exceeds 1.0 before the inspection, the crack may not develop into blade\nfailure even if it may be initiated, due to the characteristics of fatigue phenomena. Generally, in\nthis case the same operating routine as before is permissible until the next periodic inspection, if\nsufficiently long operation has been experienced by that time. Naturally, it is better, however, to\noperate carefully by intensive frequency control with confirmation of the individual turbine\noperating limitations.\nParticularly during a special operation, such as under high exhaust hood temperature, high\nexhaust humidity, or lengthy operation with low pressure exhaust hood spray, much more\ncareful observation is required.\na"

However, troubles should be prevented in advance by\ndetecting their symptoms of trouble in the equipment and devices in operation before such\nundesired condition may be observed. For this purpose, periodical tests and routine inspections of\ncontrol equipment and devices are recommended.\nMost of troubles can be detected and prevented by periodical tests and routine inspection, and it is\nessential to know and understand the meanings of results and findings to be obtained through such\nperiodic tests and inspection.\nDescribed in paragraph 4 \"Trouble shooting\" are typical or common situation of troubles that may\nhappen in the control equipment and devices during operation.\n（京浜）図面管理室 2019/09/25 電子承認システム適用\nE K T 1 0 0 4 5 8 - b"

The bypass orifice line is designed to supply the minimum oil flow to the\nbearing header in case that the throttle valve is fully closed.\nBearing pressure shall be checked and adjusted at the initial start or first start of turbine unit after modification or repair\nwhich may affect the lubrication system characteristics. It is not mandatory requirement to adjust the pressure in normal\n(usual) turbine start up.\nThe throttle valve should be adjusted slowly not to change the bearing pressure suddenly.\nAdjustment process\nx\nMain oil throttle valve(*0MAV15AA003) is fully opened before one of the main oil pumps(*0MAV15AP001KP01,\n*0MAV16AP001KP01) is started.\nx\nWhen a main oil pump is started, check if the bearing oil pressure at the front standard is over 0.2MPag.\nx\nAfter turning operation is started, the bearing pressure will be slightly decreased. Bearing pressure shall be adjusted\nto approx. 0.2MPag by adjusting the throttle valve.\nx\nDuring turbine speed up, the bearing pressure will be decreased as turbine speed is increased. Check the bearing oil\npressure carefully and adjust the throttle valve to keep the bearing oil pressure 0.18MPag or higher.\nx\nThe viscosity of the lube oil changes with its temperature, so the lube oil pressure may change when temperature is\nnot stabilized. The lube oil temperature is increased as turbine speed is increased and the temperature becomes\nstabilized some time after turbine load reaches to the rated load. Bearing pressure shall be checked periodically until\nthe feeding oil temperature reaches sufficient stability.\nx\nIn case bearing oil pressure is changed, adjust to 0.18MPag by adjusting the throttle valve.\nPurpose of each pressure indicator/transmitter\nx\nAT BEARING HEADER(*MAV49CP001) - The bearing header pressure transmitter represents the oil pressure at\nthe turbine operating floor elevation so it is the actual inlet pressure to the main bearings. It is normally set about\n0.18MPag when the turbine is running at rated speed.\nx\nAT OIL PUMP DISCHARGE(*0MAV15CP501, *0MAV16CP501, *0MAV12CP501) - The oil pump discharge\npressure is measured at the upstream of the check valve. This indicator is used for checking if the check valve is\nopened or closed.\nx\nAT FRONT STANDARD - This is for checking the bearing oil pressure at the turbine level of the system.\nA pressure indicator is mounted on the front standard.\nPurpose of each Temperature indicator/element\nx"
