    "text": "3. Introduction\nThis section provides the procedure for routine startup and shutdown of the turbine. The\nrecommended sequence for placing the turbine and its related equipment in or out of service is\na practical procedure which can contribute to the satisfactory performance of the turbine\ngenerator.\nIt is extremely important that most of the operating steps be carried out in the sequence given\nhere, and that recommendations be closely followed. Toshiba ESS Corporation acknowledges\nthat the practices of different generating organizations may deviate from the sequence\nrecommended in this manual, and it is not possible to address every deviation from the\nprocedure and the conditions under which such deviations are permissible.\nTherefore, any deviation from recommended operating procedure should be undertaken only by\nexperienced personnel at the responsibility of the power generating organization.\nThe operator should use this procedure as a checklist to avoid omitting any necessary operation.\nExperienced operating personnel should exercise judgment in deviating from the operating\npractices recommended here.\nFor example, in turbine shutdown, if condenser vacuum is broken, deceleration of the turbine is\ngreater because of the increased windage, and shut-down time is reduced. However, there is no\nreason vacuum must be broken at all, so long as the steam seal system remains in operation.\nExperienced personnel will know that this is highly advantageous for a shutdown of short\nduration, because if air is not drawn into the condensate system, condenser vacuum does not\nhave to be reestablished for restarting. The steam seal system should never be shut down before\nzero vacuum is obtained.\nThe successful operation, maintenance, and long life of a turbine-generator are dependent, to a\nlarge extent, on the proper startup, loading, shutdown, and load changing procedures. These\nprocedures become more important as units undergo frequent starting and loading cycles.\nIn many instances, a turbine may appear to start without difficulty, in spite of the use of improper\nmethods. During early service trouble may not be evident, but unnecessary damage may be\noccurring that will not be identified until much later. These damages may include packing\nrubbing, shell distortion, or the cracking of turbine parts. These conditions can be avoided if\nproper operating methods are used.\nRecent failures of major turbine components have been directly attributable to cracking from\naccumulated strain damage, which resulted from numerous heating and cooling cycles\nconducted frequently and at rates in excess of Toshiba's recommendations. Analysis further\nindicates that the thermal strains associated with quick cooling times are likely to swiftly drive\ncracks deeper.\nThese starting and loading instructions are designed primarily to minimize cyclic damage to the\nhigh temperature rotors, but they also limit cyclic damage to the shells. The turbine rotors are\nrecognized to be the limiting equipment in most modern turbine generator units. When the shells\nare more limiting, it is by a small margin.\na\nE K S 1 0 1 3 3 9 - a"

    "subsection": "",
    "text": "4.1. Thermal Stress and Distortion\nDuring steady state operation, the combined pressure and thermal stresses in the valves and\nshells, and combined centrifugal and thermal stresses in the rotors are maintained at a relatively\nlow level. However, during transient operations such as startup, shutdown, load changes, and\nemergencies, large thermal stresses can be added to the pressure stress in the shells and valves\nand to the centrifugal stresses in the rotors. A severe transient may produce yielding, which\nconsumes a certain percentage of the fatigue life of the yielded component. The amount of life\nexpenditure depends on the level of combined stress reached during each operation. It is\ntherefore important to limit these stresses to an acceptable level by controlling the rates of\ntemperature change.\n4.1.1.\nTemperature\nControl. The primary objective during turbine starting and loading is the gradual, uniform\nheating of critical turbine parts to minimize thermal stress. The critical portions include the\ncontrol valve chest, first-stage nozzle bowl passages, first-stage shell area, high-pressure and\nreheat rotors, and for most units, the stop-valve casing.\nThese parts are mainly in the hottest portions of the turbine in the high-pressure and reheat\nsections.\n4.1.2.\nTemperature Limitations\nTemperature differences across the thick walls of shells and valves should not exceed\nmaximums recommended on separate curves of allowable temperature difference, Figures 4.1\nand 4.2. These curves are designed to optimize the life expenditure per cycle in the stationary\nparts.\nRates of change of metal temperature should not exceed the maximums recommended on the\nseparate curve of cyclic damage curve of rotor. This curve for the high-pressure section is shown\non Figure 4.3.\nThese rates of change limits are based on limiting the life expenditure per cycle in the high-\npressure rotor to satisfactory levels. Because dependable measurements of rotor temperature are\nnot practical, the temperature of the closest stationary parts must be used as a substitute. The\nthermocouple closest to the high-pressure rotor is at the first-stage shell inner surface. The\nlimitations are given in the form of curves of rate of metal temperature change as a function of\nthe amount of metal temperature change expected, for various rotor surface cyclic life\nexpenditures given in percent per cycle.\na\nE K S 1 0 1 3 3 9 - a"

Load increase and load decrease rate during transient cycles.\nThe curves of rate of change of metal temperature assume that the selected life expenditures\nare the same during the heating and cooling halves of the cycle.\nHowever, if the startup or load increases will be slow, consuming say 0.01 percent per\ncycle, and the shutdown or load reductions will be faster, consuming say 0.02 percent per\ncycle, the net life expenditure during a complete cycle of this type would be approximately\nthe average of 0.01 and 0.02, or 0.015 percent per cycle.\nThe rate of change of temperature in the first-stage shell is therefore a basic consideration\nduring starting, loading, and unloading. In general, the rotors have higher combined stresses\nthan the stationary parts and tend to be the limiting item. For this reason, operators should\npay attention to the rates of change limitations.

    "subsection": "",
    "text": "4.2. Vibration\nDuring the rolling period, particularly on new turbines with tight packings, light packing\nrubbing may develop regardless of optimum procedures and thermal conditions. This is more\nlikely to occur when operating near critical speed when the midspan rotor deflections are at\nmaximum. If the rubbing exists because of increased vibration while operating below or near a\ncritical speed, the turbine should be shut down immediately and put on turning gear for one or\ntwo hours. This procedure will straighten the shaft, and a restart usually can be accomplished\nwithout further rubbing.\nContinued operation at or near the critical speed will usually increase the bowing at an\naccelerating rate, damaging the turbine packings and reducing turbine efficiency. In extreme\ncases, permanent rotor bowing can result.\nRubbing during rolling is minimized by steady, smooth acceleration, particularly through the\ncritical speeds. Below critical speeds, unbalance caused by rotor bow increases the bow, leading\nto harder rubbing and, consequently, more bowing. At speeds above critical, unbalance caused\nby bowing tends to decrease the bow and relieve rubbing.\nRubbing at speeds above critical is not as troublesome as at lower speeds. Through the critical\nspeed range, deflections of the rotor may be greatly amplified; therefore, operators should\naccelerate through the critical speeds quickly.\nOperators of a particular unit will quickly learn its starting characteristics, and will be able to\ndifferentiate normal and abnormal vibration levels at any given speed. As the unit is accelerated,\nfor example, it is perfectly normal for the vibration at the generator journal bearings to increase\nin amplitude at the generator's first critical speed. Amplitudes less than 150μm might be\nconsidered normal and 200μm acceptable. This value is usually constant for a particular unit\nand will not vary much with operating circumstances. In some cases, the last turbine bearing\nwill respond in part with the generator, and this may also be normal.\nThe 3000 rpm turbine shaft vibration amplitudes, especially HP shafts, will rarely be higher\nthan 75μm at low speeds under 900 rpm. If they should reach 125μm it indicates severe\nrubbing. Modern large steam turbines for 3000 rpm operation have first rotor critical speeds in\nthe range between 900 and 2700 rpm. At these speeds some increase in shaft vibration amplitude\nis normal.\nIn deciding whether normal vibration exists, operators should consider whether the peak\nvibration speed has been reached or approached, and how fast the vibration is changing. In\ngeneral, at or near the turbine's first critical speed, shaft vibration amplitudes should not exceed\ntwice the normal amplitudes.\nIn a few cases, vibration amplitudes near 150μm are normal for a particular unit, and slightly\nhigher than this is tolerable for a few moments while the turbine is accelerating through the\ncritical speed range.\nAt the first indication of abnormal vibration levels while below the critical speed range, or while\npassing through it, the unit should be instantly tripped and placed on turning gear. After a well\nbalanced unit has passed through the critical speed range, the vibration amplitudes will diminish.\na\nE K S 1 0 1 3 3 9 - a"

    "subsection": "",
    "text": "5.7. Turbine Shutdown Procedure\nA controlled shutdown procedure is desirable for the proper operation of the turbine during load\nreduction and subsequent shutdown of the unit.\nAs in turbine startup, the control of turbine metal temperature is extremely important since this\nwill affect thermal stress, differential expansions, distortion or alignment of parts, and the flow\nof heat from one portion of the turbine to another.\nVarious procedures should be developed for each system. These procedures should be governed\nby the conditions desired at shutdown, or which are later desired at restarting.\nIdentical turbines may require different procedures adapted to the related equipment and\ncontrols. The emergency or trip functions of the control equipment, and the normal turbine\ncontrol operation are described in the description instructions. In addition, the tests to be\nperformed periodically during shutdown are described in “Surveillance Test”.\nLoad should be reduced at a uniform rate of decrease of inner surface metal temperature, as\ngiven on the cyclic damage curve of the rotor chart.\nWhen the desired minimum load has been reached, trip the machine off line to stop the steam\nsupply to the turbine. If it is necessary to open the vacuum breaking valve, open it below the\nrecommended speed. If emergency conditions dictate that the shaft be stopped as quickly as\npossible, break the vacuum immediately. When the unit is tripped while operating under any\nappreciable load, do not open the circuit breakers until the main stop valves are closed. This\nshould provide the best protection against overspeed within the turbine if the main stop valves\nfail to close properly.\nNOTE\n■ The shorter the period of the shutdown cycles, the greater must be the coordination and precision\nof the operation. To ensure the best conditions when the turbine is restarted, the shutdown\nprocedure should remove the load in orderly fashion; perform any safely tests required; avoid\nundesirable stresses in the turbine metal; prevent distortions of the hot parts, including valves,\nshells, and rotors; and operate the unit and all auxiliary equipment during load reduction and\nshutdown.\n5.7.1.\nGeneral Shutdown\nFor many units, the characteristics of the main steam supply enable relatively small changes in\nmain steam temperatures to take place during a large portion of the load reduction period. This\nis frequently advantageous because if the steam temperature is to remain about constant during\nthe unloading, the temperature changes within the turbine will be held to a minimum. The\ntemperature of the parts in the region of the first stage will change the greatest amount.\nAs load is reduced at constant throttle conditions, the first-stage temperature will decrease by\nthe amount given by the curve of first-stage temperature versus load. Below the control point of\nthe boiler, the unloading rate should be reduced to compensate for the decrease in main steam\ntemperature to remain within the metal temperature rate of change limit.\na\nE K S 1 0 1 3 3 9 - a"

This is desirable when only a short time is available for an outage and work is to be\nperformed on the turbine. This will permit the shortest time between shutdown and disassembly,\nlessen the possibility of thermal distortion of the parts, and reduce the discomfort of operating\npersonnel.\nCooling may be accomplished during the load reduction by decreasing the main steam\ntemperature. This decrease should be gradual and uniform, not exceeding the allowable rate of\nmetal temperature decrease nor the allowable metal wall differentials. To accomplish the\ngreatest decrease in temperature, it may be necessary to reduce steam pressure as well.\nThis method of cooling will produce the greatest temperature decrease in the high-pressure\nsection of the turbine, and the effect on the portion of the turbine from the crossover point to\nthe exhaust will be progressively less.\n5.7.3.\nShutdown in the Shortest Period\nWhen a shutdown is required in the shortest period of time, the emergency rate of temperature\nchange decrease limit may be used. The time required to shut down can further be reduced by\ntripping the unit as soon as load has been reduced to 1/3 rated.\n5.7.4.\nLoad Removal and Shutdown\nLoad should be reduced in such a way as to limit the rate of change of first-stage shell inner\nsurface metal temperature to the values given on the cyclic damage curve of rotor chart.\nAlthough other methods are used, some of the most desirable are described below in the order"

It is also equipped with the various kinds of air ports having\nthe Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emission control function.\n Conservative Furnace design\nSubbituminous coal such as PRB (Powder River Basin) coal in USA has severe\nslagging characteristics. The Furnace of the Boiler is designed to prevent it from\nslagging trouble.\n Optimum placement and clearance of Burners\nEnough clearance is made between the water-wall surfaces and the Burners to\nprevent deposits of ash and slag caused by impingement between the flames and\nFurnace walls. For the large boilers, the Burners are arranged on the front and the\nrear walls so called as the opposed firing system.\n Minimizing slagging on the Furnace Walls applying a Boundary Air\nSystem\nAn oxidizing (air rich) atmosphere is maintained in the vicinity of the Furnace Walls\nby introducing a small amount of air from the hopper bottom section which comes\nup along the Furnace walls. This arrangement is called the \"Boundary Air system\".\nFig. 3.1.1.1 (a) Boundary Air System\n Minimizing use of the refractory castable\nThe Furnace is designed with minimum use of refractory castable (such as Burner\nthroats and observation ports) which could cause slagging as a result of the high\nsurface temperature during operation.\n( 76 / 258 )"

The screen tubes part is arranged at the inlet of the\nSH zone and RH zone of the HRA for the flue gas flowing to the zone respectively.\nThe saturated steam from the separator flows into the furnace roof inlet header\nthrough the separator outlet steam pipes and flows downward the HRA rear wall\nthrough the roof wall tubes. The heated steam is collected in the HRA partition wall\ninlet header and the part of the steam is distributed to the HRA front and side wall\ninlet headers through the connecting pipes.\nAll the steam passing through the front, side and intermediate walls of the HRA is\ncollected in the HRA intermediate outlet header before flowing into the primary\nsuper heaters.\n( 80 / 258 )"

General\n4-2\nGeneral\nCoal Specification\nThis sub-section explains the Coal Specification to be fired for this Project.\nDesign Coal Specification\nThe Design coal specification is specified in Table 1 of VP1-C-L1-G-GEN-00502 (K090-055) Fuel\nSpecification for Boiler and Auxiliary Design.\nThe boilers were designed based on this Design Coal Specification. Burning coals not identified in the\nDesign Coal Specification and not evaluated by IHI can seriously damage the boiler. IHI and EPC\ncontractors shall not be responsible for problems resulting from burning coals that do not meet the coal\nspecification for which the boiler was designed.\nCoal Brand and Coal / Ash Properties\nCoals are normally named or branded for the location where they are mined. The coal’s composition,\nwhile variable, is normally defined by the commercial specification for the specific brand. A coal’s brand\nis important information for the boiler operator. While ultimately it is critical to know the specific physical\nand chemical properties and characteristics of the coal, the boiler operators also need to know the brand\nbecause typical coal and ash analysis cannot determine the combustion and slagging/fouling\ncharacteristics precisely.\nUse of Non Listed Coal\nThe Owner should not fire any coals not specified in the Project Coal Specification. If the Owner\nnevertheless does fire coals not specified in the Project Coal Specification shall take all risks related to\nfiring such coals.\nCoal Blending\nMany properties of coal are pure physical properties, and when coals are blended with other coals, the\nresulting property of the blended coal, such as heating value, moisture content, total ash content, and\nash chemical composition, is the weighted average of the individual coal properties. However, some\nproperties and characteristics of coals, such as ash fusion temperatures, fouling index, sintering\ntemperatures and grindability, cannot be confidently predicted by the weighted average of the individual\ncoal properties. Therefore, when coal is blended, the analysis of the actual blended coal is necessary.\nBlending coals can lead to unpredictable results and should only be done with great caution. The boiler\noperator cannot and should not rely on the mathematical weighted prediction of the analysis of the\nblended coal.\nEspecially, when two different coal brands are blended, the ash of this blended coal may have\ncharacteristics completely different from the weighted average of these characteristics for the individual\ncoal brands. Ash fusion temperatures of a blended coal can be lower than either of the individual\nconstituent coals.\nTherefore, if coals are to be blended a coal and ash (including ash fusion temperature) analysis should\nbe carried out on both the individual constituent coals and the blend. Coals should be blended before\nbunkering and not in the boiler furnace.\n( 127 / 258 )"

Burning new coal brand without a test burn can have detrimental effects on boiler operation\nand component reliability. Also, a test burn is required whenever a blend of new combination of coal\nbrands are envisaged.\nThe test burn is to determine whether firing at full load is achievable while keeping within the emission\nlimitation\nand\nto\ndetermine\nthe\npotential\nfor\ndeterioration\nof\nboiler\nperformance\nand\nslagging/fouling/sintering.\nThe sintering test was developed by IHI and provides practical and useful information concerning the\nsub-bituminous coal.

These suppress the\nsolubility of magnetite (Fe3O4), which is the surface coating of carbon steel making up the\nboiler tube, to prevent overall corrosion and to control local corrosion such as pitting,\nthereby preventing carbon steel from corrosion.\nSince magnetite has a coarse crystal lattice and a high generation rate, the scale\nattached to inside the tube grows excessively large, causing a problem of an increase in\nboiler differential pressure and impeding stable operation of the feedwater system control\nvalve. As a countermeasure for this problem, it is necessary to remove the scale by\nperiodic chemical cleaning (every 4 years).\n\nAVT-R（All Volatile Treatment with Hydrazine）\nThis method increases pH to 9 or more and perform mechanical degassing with a\ndeaerator. In addition to ammonia, an oxygen scavenger such as hydrazine is used to\npromote dearetion.\nSince hydrazine destroy the hematite layer which is made by CWT operation and is firmer\nthan magnetite layer, AVT-R mode is applied only during the beginning of commissioning\nbefore formed magnetite layer.\n( 165 / 258 )"

    "text": "5.1. General\n5-2\n5.1.\nGeneral\nA structured inspection and regular maintenance plan for maintaining a modern coal-fired boiler in a safe\nand non-degraded condition is very important. The Owner must hire a reliable maintenance specialist\nand prudently conduct maintenance even when this may cause the plant to require more down time off\nthe grid.\nA care must be exercised to ensure that its operation limits are not exceeded. The unit is maintained and\noperated in accordance with recognized good practice, the service will be satisfactory. When faulty\noperation, excessive temperatures, or other abnormal conditions cause the safe limits of the material to\nbe exceeded, failures will occur rapidly, and the equivalent of years of normal deterioration may take\nplace in a short time.\nBy conducting a program of routine maintenance on a boiler and other power plant equipment, the\nproduction and life of the equipment are optimized. At one time, maintenance focused on the repair of\ndamaged equipment; however, this operating philosophy has evolved into a sophisticated set of programs\nthat include assessing the condition of the equipment, techniques for predicting the life of the equipment,\ndeveloping corrective measures, preventing future problems, and evaluating the overall operation. It is\nthe goal of a maintenance program to optimize production, availability, and safety, while at the same time\nto minimize operating costs and any effect on the environment.\nIn any power plant, maintenance activities should include preventive maintenance procedures, which are\nactivities performed for the purpose of avoiding or at least minimizing the probability of failure of a piece\nof equipment or a portion of a system. They are usually performed on a component that has a fairly clear\ndefined life expectancy. By preparing a good history record of maintenance, a good preventative\nmaintenance program can be developed that can anticipate potential failures.\n( 196 / 258 )"

    "text": "5.4. Boiler Inspection\n5-44\n5.4.3.\nIrregular (Boiler Tube Leak)\nThis section describes the inspection when tube leak is suspected as an irregular inspection.\nIf you suspect a boiler tube leak during plant operation, you need to stop the operation, identify the leak\nlocation, repair it, and restart it. If the tube leak is left for a long time, the damage will spread, so we\nrecommend that you do it promptly to minimize the secondary damage from boiler tube leaks.\nIn addition, before stopping operation, opening a manhole (in some cases setting a foothold) and finding\na leak point, it is recommended to move to the discovery process with an idea of where it is.\nThe following is a list of inspection items for estimating the boiler tube leak locations.\nHowever, depending on the structure, the location of the leak, and the degree of steam leakage, it may\nnot always possible to estimate even if it is carried out before shut-down. In addition, as a result of\nstopping and inspection, boiler tube leaks have not been reached, and there may be other problems that\nare not boiler tube leaks. Please make a comprehensive judgment and estimate whether it is a boiler\ntube leak.\n Check for leak noise and other unusual noises around the boiler pressure part.\n(Detect the noise inexhaustibly after stopping the sootblower)\n Infer based on operation data and previous boiler inspection results.\nThe following is a list of items that should be checked after finding a boiler tube leak.\n Confirmation of secondary damage caused by water vapor leaked from the first punctured part.\nFurthermore, confirmation of the presence or absence of further damage due to water vapor leaked\nfrom the secondary punctured hole.\n Confirmation that the upstream and downstream pipes in the flow of the punctured part are not\ndamaged.\nAfter repairing the tube leak, confirm the integrity of the repair site by NDT, water pressure, etc.\nIdentify the cause of tube leak and check and confirm that similar trouble has not occurred at other parts.\nBy the same factor, similar trouble can occur at different parts.\nEven if inspected, the damaged part may not be identified. In that case, it is one of the options to find it\nby sealing the water in the pressure-proof part.\nIn addition, the degree of damage may be significant, even if it is not completely damaged or even\npunctured. After considering the cause of the damage, we recommend checking the area where the same\ndamage can be expected to occur.\nPay attention to the the following items during the tube repair works;\n・ Work with a fully skilled welder using appropriate materials, thicknesses, and welding rods, using\nappropriate welding methods.\n・ Active use of water soluble paper is not recommended. When using, it is recommended to keep\nthe sample and to record the place and amount of use. When using water soluble paper, it is\nnecessary to sufficiently raise and hold the temperature of the boiler water so that it melts firmly.\n・ Tube repair work with great care not to leave foreign matter inside the pipe.\n( 238 / 258 )"

Boiler Repair and Chemical Cleaning\n5-54\n5.5.3.\nBoiler Chemical Cleaning\nIf the scale adheres to the tube and the scale thickness increases, the following problems may occur.\n The scale in the pipe adheres and accumulates, and the peeled scale scatters to the outside of the\nboiler system as it flows into the steam flow, causing damage to the turbine blades.\n Tube leak due to flow inhibition by scale in the tube.\n (Pressure increase due to excessive rise of metal temperature, furnace path, HRA path, superheater\npath, reheater path, etc.)\n Damage in the pressure resistant part due to the thermal expansion difference generated by the\nimbalance of metal temperature.\nMeasure the thickness of the scale in the pipe regularly, consider the timing of chemical cleaning, and\ncarry out the chemical cleaning by an appropriate method.\n( 248 / 258 )\n\n5.

The bypass orifice line is designed to supply the minimum oil flow to the\nbearing header in case that the throttle valve is fully closed.\nBearing pressure shall be checked and adjusted at the initial start or first start of turbine unit after modification or repair\nwhich may affect the lubrication system characteristics. It is not mandatory requirement to adjust the pressure in normal\n(usual) turbine start up.\nThe throttle valve should be adjusted slowly not to change the bearing pressure suddenly.\nAdjustment process\nx\nMain oil throttle valve(*0MAV15AA003) is fully opened before one of the main oil pumps(*0MAV15AP001KP01,\n*0MAV16AP001KP01) is started.\nx\nWhen a main oil pump is started, check if the bearing oil pressure at the front standard is over 0.2MPag.\nx\nAfter turning operation is started, the bearing pressure will be slightly decreased. Bearing pressure shall be adjusted\nto approx. 0.2MPag by adjusting the throttle valve.\nx\nDuring turbine speed up, the bearing pressure will be decreased as turbine speed is increased. Check the bearing oil\npressure carefully and adjust the throttle valve to keep the bearing oil pressure 0.18MPag or higher.\nx\nThe viscosity of the lube oil changes with its temperature, so the lube oil pressure may change when temperature is\nnot stabilized. The lube oil temperature is increased as turbine speed is increased and the temperature becomes\nstabilized some time after turbine load reaches to the rated load. Bearing pressure shall be checked periodically until\nthe feeding oil temperature reaches sufficient stability.\nx\nIn case bearing oil pressure is changed, adjust to 0.18MPag by adjusting the throttle valve.\nPurpose of each pressure indicator/transmitter\nx\nAT BEARING HEADER(*MAV49CP001) - The bearing header pressure transmitter represents the oil pressure at\nthe turbine operating floor elevation so it is the actual inlet pressure to the main bearings. It is normally set about\n0.18MPag when the turbine is running at rated speed.\nx\nAT OIL PUMP DISCHARGE(*0MAV15CP501, *0MAV16CP501, *0MAV12CP501) - The oil pump discharge\npressure is measured at the upstream of the check valve. This indicator is used for checking if the check valve is\nopened or closed.\nx\nAT FRONT STANDARD - This is for checking the bearing oil pressure at the turbine level of the system.\nA pressure indicator is mounted on the front standard.\nPurpose of each Temperature indicator/element\nx"
